# BMeshGeneration

This is a little showcase of generating a 3D model from multiple nodes.

We Create Nodes that represent the body part of the model and hierarchise them with the unity hierarchy transform.

It was greatly inspired by 
- [Blender Skin Modifier](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/skin.html) 
- Ji, Zhongping; Liu, Ligang; Wang, Yigang (2010). [B-Mesh](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.357.7134&rep=rep1&type=pdf) : A Fast Modeling System for Base Meshes of 3D Articulated Shapes
